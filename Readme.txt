Brief description:
Simulates a simple atmospheric model using a Lennard-Jones fluid using a Nose-Hoover thermostat, producing a 3D graphical model of the system that evolves in time.
Parameters of the atmospheric model are set in the param.txt file (refer to the documentation for explaination regarding the parameters).

Requirements:
Compile on a UNIX system using the Makefile, with GLUT libraries installed (see Libraries.h file for required libraries).
