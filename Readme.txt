Brief description:
Simulates a simple atmospheric model using a Lennard-Jones fluid using a Nose-Hoover thermostat, producing a 3D graphical model of the system that evolves in time.
Parameters of the atmospheric model are set in the param.txt file (refer to the documentation for explaination regarding the parameters).

Requirements:
Compile on a UNIX system using the Makefile, with GLUT libraries installed (see Libraries.h file for required libraries).

Results:
See Presentation/droplet_vid.wmv (warning: 46.8MB in size) for a demonstration of the program results.

Shoutouts:
Many thanks to A/Prof. Hisashi Okumura from the Institute of Molecular Science in Okazaki, Japan for supervising me for the duration of the EXODASS project!!
